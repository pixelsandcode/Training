this is my lesson one answer.
you should run the lesson1.js with nodejs and in the terminal, now you have a localhost server at http://localhost:8080/ :

http://localhost:8080/docs opens the documentation of server routes,

http://localhost:8080/hello/username says hi to the user,

http://localhost:8080/nader says hi to the user in another way.
